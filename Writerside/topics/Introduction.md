# Introduction

StoryTailor is an application which allows you to make Visual Novel
games easily on both mobile and PC.

StoryTailor is still in alpha, meaning the application is unstable and
unfit for serious production uses.

StoryTailor is not like Roblox where you make a game for the platform
 itself. In StoryTailor, You make your Visual Novel game 
and then you can export it to an executable (.exe, .apk, etc.) 
and self-publish it on itch.io, Steam, etc.

## Exporting to different game engines
Other than allowing you to export your project into executables,
 StoryTailor also allows you to export your project to other game
 engines, such as exporting to Unity, Godot, or even RenPy.
