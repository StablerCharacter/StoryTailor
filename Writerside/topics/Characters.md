# Characters

**Implementation Stage:** Planned

Characters in StoryTailor are basically a collection of images related to one thing.

A character consists of a name and different variants of the character's image.

You can organize a character like however you wanted. If, for example, You're creating 
a character that is both a hero and a normal person, You can create two separate 
characters, which is the Hero form and a Normal person form, Or create one character 
and put both the Hero form and a Normal person form as a variant in the same character.
