# Implementation Stages

These are the implementation stages you will see throughout this documentation.

Implemented
: The feature is implemented and now meets its purpose.
  But improvements are always welcome.

Partially Implemented
: The feature is implemented, but the implementation is not complete yet.
  The feature might not fully meet its purpose, or might look bad if you use it as it is.

Planned
: The feature is planned, but the implementation is nowhere to be found.
