# Developer Tools Overlay

**Implementation Stage:** Partially Implemented

<p>
    When previewing, You can open the StoryTailor developer tools overlay 
    by touch and hold, or press <shortcut>F10</shortcut>.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, The developer tools overlay only has an option to quit 
    the game, which you can use the <shortcut>Escape</shortcut> key to 
    do that as well.
