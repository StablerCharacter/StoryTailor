# Main Menu

**Implementation Stage:** Planned

The main menu is the entry point of your game, just like what
you usually see in games where when you open the game, you see
the play button, settings, and the quit button.

The main menu might be the scene with the most customization 
options available. As the main menu is likely unique to each game.
