# Contributing to StoryTailor
There is no definitive guide on how to write your code  
or how to write documentation. As long as you don't mix 
10 different coding/writing styles, it's going to 
be fine. But there are still some guidelines you 
might want to follow to give the end user the best
experience.

## Contributing to the Code
There is no real guide of how to write code in this
repository. Try to write clean code if possible so
people can easily understand it. It'll even be of
great help to make the existing code cleaner.

To start contributing to the code, Please choose a 
code editor or IDE for developing with Flutter.
[**Android Studio**](https://developer.android.com/studio/) 
and [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
 are generally the choice many people choose.

If you decided to use Android Studio, It would be a great 
idea for you to use JetBrains Toolbox to install it.
So it will be easier to update and manage your IDEs, 
and you can then install JetBrains Writerside through 
it too, in the case that the guide needs to be updated.

## Contributing to the Guide
The StoryTailor Guide is basically the documentation of 
StoryTailor. It is written using JetBrains Writerside.

You'll be needing JetBrains Writerside to contribute to 
the Guide due to the special Markdown syntax in 
JetBrains Writerside.

You can view the Getting Started guide for JetBrains
Writerside [here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/writerside/getting-started.html)

When writing the documentation, Try to keep it clean, 
clear, and concise. Use the extra features provided 
by JetBrains Writerside to make the documentation 
less boring.
